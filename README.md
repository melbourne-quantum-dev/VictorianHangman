**Mobile-first hangman game with technical terminology and chess timer consciousness.**

Built with thumbs, vibes, and systematic pattern recognition. Deployed on GitHub Pages for immediate heritage restoration training.

---

## 🎮 What This Is

Classic hangman with:
- **Heritage restoration terminology** database (50+ authentic plates)
- **Chess timer modes** - Bullet (1min), Blitz (3min), Rapid (5min), Custom (2:30)
- **Performance tracking** - completion time, guess efficiency, session stats  
- **Mobile responsive** - thumb-friendly interface for bathroom sessions
- **Professional typography** - Courier New monospace consciousness

**Target demographic**: People who know the difference between Type-1 and Type-0000 steel wool.

## 📋 License & Usage

**Open source** with practical usage focus. Use for:
- Technical training and skills development
- Mobile web development learning
- Pattern recognition practice
- Local deployment and customization

**Commercial use**: No way cunt.

## 🎯 Features That Actually Work

- **Authentic terminology**: Real technical terms, not random dictionary words
- **Timer pressure**: Forces pattern recognition vs overthinking analysis
- **Session tracking**: Win/loss ratios, fastest completions, efficiency metrics
- **Error handling**: Prevents crashes, validates input, handles edge cases
- **Mobile optimized**: Works on phones without breaking layout
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+Shift+D (debug), Ctrl+Shift+S (stats)

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

**Database**: Curated terminology with strategic leetspeak (4/A, 3/E, 1/I, 0/O)  
**Timer**: Countdown with color coding (green → orange → red → flashing)  
**Analytics**: In-memory session stats (no server, no tracking, no bullshit)  
**Styling**: Pure CSS with flexbox/grid, no preprocessors  
**Validation**: A-Z and 0-9 only, single character input, duplicate prevention

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

- **Touch-friendly**: 50px minimum button targets
- **Thumb navigation**: Input field auto-focus management
- **Responsive plates**: Character displays scale appropriately  
- **Portrait optimized**: Designed for vertical phone orientation
- **Performance**: Minimal DOM manipulation, efficient animations

## 🤝 Contributing

**Code quality expectations:**
- **Readable functions** with clear purposes
- **No unnecessary complexity** - keep it simple
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Systematic error handling** with user feedback

**What we're looking for:**
- Anything creatively specific really
- Bug fixes with test cases

**What we're not looking for:**
- Framework rewrites (React, Vue, etc.)
- Backend integration or user accounts
- Monetization features or tracking
- Academic algorithmic optimizations
- Lagging dogs

## 🎮 Game Modes

**Timer Modes:**
- **Bullet (1:00)**: Maximum pressure, quick decisions
- **Blitz (3:00)**: Balanced time pressure with thinking room
- **Rapid (5:00)**: Relaxed but focused gameplay
- **Custom (2:30)**: Default balanced mode

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Completion time**: How fast you solve each word
- **Guess efficiency**: Word length vs total guesses ratio
- **Session stats**: Running totals across multiple games
- **Personal bests**: Fastest completion times tracked

## 🔍 Technical Debt

**Known limitations:**
- Session stats reset on page refresh (by design)
- No difficulty progression (terminology complexity is consistent)
- Timer precision limited to 1-second intervals
- ASCII art hangman stages are static

**Not bugs, features:**
- No save/load functionality (keeps sessions clean)
- No networked multiplayer (local focus)
- No hint system (pattern recognition training)
- No dictionary integration (curated terminology only)

## 📊 Browser Support

**Tested on:**
- Firefox Focus mobile (iOS 18+)
- Firefox desktop

**Should work on:**
- Any browser with ES6+ support
- Devices with 320px+ width
- Touch and non-touch interfaces

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Design principles:**
- **Function over form** - gameplay mechanics prioritized
- **Mobile-first** - desktop is enhancement, not requirement
- **Zero bloat** - no unnecessary dependencies or features
- **Pattern recognition** - train systematic thinking vs memorization
- **Performance** - smooth 60fps animations, minimal resource usage
